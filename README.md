Status WIP. 

The goal of the project is to create a minimalist cross platform C compiler. 

It is heavily inspired by https://github.com/rui314/8cc. I recommend studying the source code
of 8cc before contributing here.

Project Trajectory/Stretch Goals.

 * Compiling non trivial C99/C11 programs with x86_64 with a non optimising backend on linux/windows/macos. Compiling Go1.4 would be a good test, as then we could bootstrap ourselves.
 * Simple optimizing backend, maintaining functionality.
 * Companion assembler/linker to remove dependence on binutils.

I really want collaborators for this project, so please discuss ideas on the project gitter before commencing work.
The project is very wip, so you will need to contact me to discuss progress/direction for various aspects of the compiler.
